### Glad to see you here! 
I am a passionate aspiring **UI/UX Designer and Business Analyst,** currently a dedicated student pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS)** and a small pastry business owner of **La Vie Patisserie** 

I am passionate to problem-solving and solving situations by analysis. Driven by purpose, I have been building core skills in technologies such as **HTML, CSS, and the Laravel framework.**

I'm an explorer of new technologies, an avid learner, a graphic designer, and a problem-solver at heart. You can ask me about cookie recipes — just don’t ask me why my code isn’t working! 😄

🍰 **Outside the programming world...**  
I enjoy cooking and baking, especially experimenting with pastries. I’m also fascinated by how food and technology can come together to create innovative solutions for everyday life.

Feel free to connect with me _@myriahvielle_ for all the things related to food and technology or simply drop and say hello! I am looking forward in shaping the croissant doughs with you. 🌟

  I once led a group project that highlighted my passion for <b>Food Technology</b>.  
  Our team enhanced a website called <i>Tastewise</i>, integrating it into the medical field.  
  This AI-powered tool was designed to provide <b>personalized recipes for individuals with chronic illnesses</b> who follow strict diets.  
  We successfully defended this project and received excellent grades for our work.
